## Future updates

1. Authentication and Authorization: Implementing a robust authentication system would ensure that only authorized users can access the application and perform certain actions. This is crucial for maintaining the security and privacy of user data.

2. User Session Filtering: Implementing a mechanism to filter user sessions would allow users to see only their own interactions and data. This would enhance the user experience and provide a personalized environment.

3. UI Styling and UX: Improving the styling of the user interface would enhance the overall user experience. By focusing on better design principles, layout, and responsiveness, the application would be more visually appealing and intuitive to use.

4. Image Display: Enhancing the search and favorite list to display images alongside user information would provide a more engaging and visually appealing experience for users.

5. Real-time Updates with Socket.io: Implementing Socket.io for real-time streaming of search operations would allow users to see live updates as search results are being retrieved. This would provide a more dynamic and interactive experience.

6. Recent Searches Display: Although recent searches are currently saved to the database, they are not displayed on the user interface as expected. Implementing a feature to display recent searches would allow users to easily access their previous search history.

7. Like Icon for Liked Users: Adding a like icon to indicate when a user has been liked in the search list would provide visual feedback to users and make it easier to identify liked users.
